# xbee_gateway

This add-on provides Ã  XBee gateway to send/receive messages
to/from a single XBee or to/from an extended XBee network.

### Integration with Home Assistant 

Communication/integration with Home Assistant is realized 
using 2 MQTT topics. 
- one for HA scripts to send messages
  - topic name proposed is `send_xbee` but is configurable
- another one to handle messages reception and passing them 
back to Home Assistant 
  - topic name proposed is `xbee_received` but is configurable

### Home Assistant requirements

On your Home Assistant you must have configured 2 needed add-ons
- **MQTT (used Mosquito broker in dev/test)**
  - define 2 topics to send and receive messages (by default `send_xbee` and`xbee_received` are proposed)
- **Samba Share**
  - used to update add-on local directory on your Home Assistant installation.

### Configuration example

    XBee_Device: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-FTDI_FT232R_USB_UART_A700e5FD-if00-port0
    XBee_Baud: 115200
    XBee_D2_State: input
    XBee_D2_Level: high
    MQTT_Host: homeassistant.local
    MQTT_Port: 1883
    MQTT_User: mqtt
    MQTT_Password: mqtt
    MQTT_Receive: xbee_received
    MQTT_Send: send_xbee
    ADDON_Logging: INFO

- XBee_Device:
    - /dev/ttyUSBx
    - /dev/ttyACMx
    - /dev/serial/by-id/...... (this one is preferable)
      - it is recommended to use a "by-id" path to the 
      device if one exists, as it is not subject to change if other devices are added
      to the system. 
      - You may find the correct value for this by going to Settings
      -> System -> Hardware and then look for USB details.
- XBee_Baud:
  - serial line baud rate
- MQTT_Receive: 
  - Topic on which add-on will publish received message
- MQTT_Send: 
  - Topic on which Home Assistant will publish message to be sent by the add-on
- ADDON_Logging: 
  - use python logging levels
    - DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL

### Dev/Tests environment where the add-on is produced

  - XBee Pro
  - Core 2024.3.0
